# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes (✅)

### 1. **Fixed Date Display Issue (NaN/08/2025)**
- **Problem**: Dates were showing as "NaN/08/2025" in the recent tickets table

- **New Order**: Status Stats → Category Cards → Recent Tickets
- **Location**: Dashboard sections are now properly ordered for better UX
